### THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPTIMIZED SOLAR PANEL POSITIONING IN BUILDINGS: LEVERAGING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND GOOGLE MAPS 

The relentless quest for sustainable energy solutions has underscored the necessity of optimizing solar energy harnessing methods. This project addresses the critical challenge of maximizing solar panel efficiency through optimized positioning on buildings, leveraging the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Google Maps. The core objective was to develop a system that intelligently analyzes various factors affecting solar energy collection, such as building orientation, surrounding obstructions, and solar irradiance, to recommend the most efficient placement of solar panels.  
 
The methodology encompassed the integration of AI algorithms with Google Maps API for precise data collection and analysis. The system utilized Particle Swarm Optimization-based Artificial Neural Networks to predict optimal solar panel positions, considering real-time and historical solar irradiance data. A web-based interface was developed, allowing users to input location data, upon which the system provided tailored recommendations for solar panel installation. 
 
Implementation challenges, including data accuracy and algorithm optimization, were systematically addressed, leading to the development of a robust platform that significantly enhances solar panel efficiency. The project's findings indicate a substantial improvement in solar energy generation when panels are positioned based on the system's recommendations, demonstrating the system's potential to reduce carbon footprints and energy costs effectively. 
The project contributes to the renewable energy field by providing a scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing solar panel positioning. It opens avenues for further research, particularly in integrating additional data sources and exploring new AI algorithms for enhanced prediction accuracy. The successful deployment of this system can accelerate the adoption of solar energy, marking a significant step toward achieving global sustainability goals.
